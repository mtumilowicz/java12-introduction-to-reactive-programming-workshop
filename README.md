## preface

The main goal of this project is to explore basic features of 
`reactive streams` introduced in `Java 9`:

* **Publisher**
* **Subscriber**
* **Subscription** (**Backpressure**)
* **Processor** (**SubmissionPublisher**)

## introduction
### general overview
* reactive programming (idea formulated by Eric Meijer)
    * the applications we developer, the programs we create must
    be really responsive and be able to react to stimuli in a 
    system
* the main objective of the reactive programming is NOT to be as fast as possible 
but to use resources (CPU, memory, ...) in the most efficient manner
    * core idea behind reactive is to release resource whenever possible
* reactive programming is functional programming+
* before java 8: completely imperative + object oriented
    * please refer: https://github.com/mtumilowicz/java12-introduction-to-functional-programming-workshop
    * imperative: tell me what tell me how
    * declarative: tell me what and NOT how
* functional (style): declarative + higher-order function
    * functional programming: function composition + lazy evaluation
* functional programming and exceptions are mutually exclusive
* exceptions + java 8 streams: if you are driving a car and
have a problem with a radio - the most illogical thing to do is to reverse back
    * you should turn off the radio and continue journey
* Michael Feather: OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts. FP makes code understandable by 
minimizing moving parts.
    * I moving part: immutability
    * II moving part: control flow (in imperative - we are going up and down to follow the flow)
### manifesto
* https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/
    * OOP four pillars: 
        * abstraction (programming is based on making abstractions), 
        * encapsulation (best practice for every programming style), 
        * inheritance (golang has no inheritance), 
        * polymorphism (makes actually OOP)
    * reactive four pillars 
        * responsive
            * infinite-scrolling
            * providing responsiveness
                * efficiency is attained not by doing tasks faster, but
                by avoiding those that shouldn't be done in the first place
        * resilient - make failure first-class citizen (it is okay
        to fail)
        * elastic - the only reasonable direction to scale is horizontally
        * message driven - do not expose your database instead
        export your data
    * reactive manifesto conclusions
        * blocking I/O limits opportunities for parallelism, so nonblocking I/O is preferred
        * synchronous interaction limits opportunities for parallelism - asynchronous 
        interaction is preferred
        * polling reduces opportunity to use fewer resources, so an event-driven style is preferred
        * if one node can bring down all other nodes, that’s a waste of resources
            * you need isolation of errors (resilience) to avoid losing all your work
        * systems need to be elastic: if there’s less demand - use fewer resources
            * if there’s more demand - use more resources, but never more than required
            
### concurrency context
* shared mutability
    ```
    Thread th = new Thread(new Runnable() {
        public void run() { // we don't produce anything and don't consume anything 
            // it could be useful only by shared mutability
            // how to work with threads if shared mutability is dangerous 
            // and thread API forces us to use it
        }
    })
    ```
* in the past the structure of sequential code was very different from the structure 
of concurrent code
    * with stream: the structure of sequential code is the same as the structure of 
    concurrent code
* how many threads should you create?
    * computation intensive <= # of cores
        * `Schedulers.computation()`
    * IO intensive = `NCPU * UCPU * (1 + W/C)`
        * NCPU is the number of cores, available through `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()`
        * UCPU is the target CPU utilization (between 0 and 1)
        * W/C is the ratio of wait time to compute time
        * `Schedulers.io()`
    * number of threads is therefore strictly limited
        * by memory also
* example of reactive application
    * excel: if you modify one cell, it propagates to other cells
    * google docs - hundreds of people use it simultaneously
### java 8 streams
* stream is not a data structure it is is actually a collection of functions (with a data source: network, file, etc.)
    * Martin Fowler: [Collection Pipeline Pattern](https://martinfowler.com/articles/collection-pipeline/)
* limitations
    * stream cannot be reused
    * single pipeline (a single terminal operation)
        * cannot split into two
    * no exceptions handling
### reactive streams
* vs java 8 streams

    |java streams   |reactive streams   |
    |---|---|
    |pipeline   |pipeline   |
    |push data   |push/pull data   |
    |lazy   |lazy   |
    |0, 1, oo   |0, 1, oo   |
    |data only   |3 channels: data, error, complete   |
    |exceptions: good luck   |deal with it downstream (error is just another form of data)  |
    |sequential vs parallel   |synch vs async   |
    |single pipeline (one terminal operation)   |multiple subscribers   |
* vs CompletableFuture

    |reactive streams   |CompletableFuture/Promises   |
    |---|---|
    |0, 1, oo   |0, 1   |
    |3 channels |2 channels (data, error) |
* there are three key factors that make a stream reactive:
    * the data is processed asynchronously
    * the backpressure (strategy of co-op with very fast producer) mechanism is non-blocking
    * the fact that the downstream can be slower than the upstream is somehow represented in the domain model
        * the Twitter streaming API, where you can be disconnected if consuming too slow
* Observable (producer) vs Observer pattern
    * it's that, plus
        * signal end of data stream
        * propagate error
        * evaluation may be synchronous, asynchronous or lazy
* nonblocking backpressure
    * BUFFER - buffers all onNext values until the downstream consumes it
    * DROP - drops the most recent onNext value if the downstream can't keep up
    * ERROR - signals a MissingBackpressureException in case the downstream can't keep up
    * LATEST - keeps only the latest onNext value, overwriting any previous value if the downstream can't keep up
    * MISSING - OnNext events are written without any buffering or dropping
* hot vs cold
    * cold = every subscriber starts fresh subscription
        * like iterator, if you start again you start from the
        beginning
    * hot = start from a point in time, like football online transmission

### past and future
* times when you have to go to bank and talk with a person
* times when you have to go to travel agency to buy tickets
* in the past companies made products for their employees to use
and make those employees (nobody cares what they think) available to us the customers
* now companies build product for real-users, IOT
### push vs pull protocols
* summary

    ![alt text](img/pull_vs_push.png)
* push protocols: 
    * the client opens a connection to the server and keeps it constantly active
    * the server will send (push) all new events to the client using that single always-on connection 
    * in other words, the server PUSHes the new events to the client
* pull protocols: 
    * the client periodically connects to the server, checks for and gets (pulls) recent events and 
then closes the connection and disconnects from the server
    * the client repeats this whole procedure to get updated about new events
    * in this mode, the clients periodically PULLs the new events from the server
* code example
    ```
    private static void pullExample() {
        final List<String> list = Lists.newArrayList("Java", "C", "C++", "PHP", "Go");
    
        final Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();
    
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(iterator.next());
        }
    }
    
    private static void pushExample() {
        final List<String> list = Lists.newArrayList("Java", "C", "C++", "PHP", "Go");
    
        final Observable<String> observable = Observable.from(list);
    
        observable.subscribe(System.out::println, System.out::println, () -> System.out.println("We are done!"));
    }
    ```

## definitions

* **[Flow.Publisher](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.Publisher.html)** - 
source of data  
* **[Flow.Subscriber](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.Subscriber.html)** - 
destination of data  
* **[Flow.Subscription](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.Subscription.html)** - 
message control linking a `Flow.Publisher` and `Flow.Subscriber` 
(`Subscriber` signal demand to `Publisher` using `Subscription`)  
* **[Flow.Processor](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.Processor.html)** - 
a component that acts as both a `Subscriber` and `Publisher` (can 
consume input and produce output).  
* **[Flow.SubmissionPublisher](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/SubmissionPublisher.html)** - 
the only one implementation (in `JDK`) of `Flow.Publisher`; has ability to asynchronously issue submitted (non-null) 
items to current subscribers until it is closed.

## data flow

```
PUBLISHER -> PROCESSOR -> PROCESSOR -> SUBSCRIBER
```

We have two scenarios:  

* `Publisher` is slow, `Subscriber` is fast (best scenario)
* `Publisher` is fast, `Subscriber` is slow (the `Subscriber` must deal 

with excessive data - the most naive approach is just to drop all 
excessive data - so the data will be lost)

Note that if we have multiple `subscribers` and one `publisher` - they 
are receiving elements in the same order.

## interaction steps

1. implement `Flow.Publisher` (using, for example `SubmissionPublisher<T>`) and `Flow.Subscriber`
1. the subscriber attempts to subscribe to the publisher by calling the 
`subscribe(Flow.Subscriber<? super T> subscriber)
    * take a look at `SubmissionPublisher.subscribe(Subscriber<? super T> subscriber)`
method of the publisher
    * success: the publisher asynchronously calls the `onSubscribe(Flow.Subscription subscription)` 
    method of the subscriber
    * failure: `onError(Throwable throwable)` method of the subscriber is called 
    with an `IllegalStateException`, and the interaction ends
1. the subscriber sends a request to the publisher for `N` items calling the `request(N)` 
on the `Subscription`
1. multiple requests are send regardless if earlier are already fulfilled (non-blocking)
1. the publisher calls the `onNext(T item)` method of the subscriber and sends an item in each call
    * if there is no more items to send the publisher calls the `onComplete()` method of the subscriber to signal
the end of stream, and interaction ends
    * note that if subscriber requests `Long.MAX_VALUE` items, the stream becomes not reactive - it is
    effectively a push stream
1. if the publisher encounters an error - calls `onError(Throwable throwable)` on subscriber
1. the subscriber can cancel its subscription by calling the `cancel()` method on its subscription
    * if a subscription is cancelled, the interaction ends 
    * it is possible for the subscriber to receive items after
    cancellation if there were pending requests before

## additional remarks

Correctly `@Override` method `onSubscribe` looks as below:

```
@Override
public void onSubscribe(Flow.Subscription subscription) {
    if (this.subscription == null) {
        this.subscription = subscription;
        this.subscription.request(1); // we handle backpressure through subscription
    }
    else {
        subscription.cancel(); // we handle cancellation through subscription
    }
}
```
* because we want our `Subscriber` talk to only one `Publisher` - 
`Subscription` represents a link between single `Subscriber` and single 
`Publisher` so you have to cancel the incoming one (if we already have 
one, we don't accept any furthers)
    * think about subscriber as a radio receiver, subscriptions as radio waves, and publisher as radio station

* the actual goal of having them included in the JDK is to provide something called a Service Provider Interface 
(or SPI) layer
    * this should eventually serve as a unification layer for different components that have reactive 
    and streaming nature, but may expose their own custom APIs, and thus not be able to interoperate with other similar 
    implementations

## tests

We test it by running:

* `RunAnswer`
* `RunWorkshop`

the output should be:

```
onNext, item: new mapping: 2
onNext, item: new mapping: 4
onNext, item: new mapping: 6
onNext, item: new mapping: 8
onNext, item: new mapping: 10
onNext, item: new mapping: 12
...
```
